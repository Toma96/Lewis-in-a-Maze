# Lewis-in-a-Maze
My bachelor final project was a computer game (desktop app) related to graph theory (mathematics) and finding the Hamiltonian paths in randomly generated graphs.

In order to run the game do the following:
  - Firstly, run the databases.py in order to create a new database for highscores.
  - Then you can run the gui.py which will open the main app window.
 
Special thanks to my mentor, prof.dr.sc. Mario Osvin Pavčević, as well as to Paul Brodersen and his netgraph project (https://github.com/paulbrodersen/netgraph) which was modified for the purposes of this project.
